<h2 class="subheading">Executive Summary</h4>

<h3 class="content">
The significant wildland fire potential forecasts included in this outlook
represent the cumulative forecasts of the ten Geographic Area Predictive
Services units and the National Predictive Services unit.
The western fire season peaked in August as very hot and dry conditions
continued under the presence of a very strong, persistent high pressure
ridge during the first three weeks of the month. Many approached or broke
all-time record highs during the second week of the month. Not
surprisingly, many fires became quite large including the Mendocino
Complex which burned more than 420,000 acres making it the largest fire
on record in California. Most fires observed were in areas of preexisting or
developing drought. Along the West Coast, drought intensification and
expansion was observed across Oregon and Washington. Further inland,
abnormally dry conditions developed across Nevada, Idaho, and western
Montana. Drought intensification and expansion was also observed across
the Great Lakes region. While pockets of extreme to exceptional drought
continued across the Four Corner states, the active monsoon was allowing
for some improvement to occur. Nearly the entire West Coast received less
than 25% of average precipitation. Significant deficits extended inland into
the Great Basin and the Northern Rockies where large areas received less
than 50% of average precipitation. Most of Texas and the central Great
Plains received above average precipitation in August. Amounts across
Oklahoma, Kansas, and Arkansas received 200% to 400% of average
precipitation. The East Coast received similar amounts. Temperatures
nationwide were generally near to slightly above average except across
the central Great Plains where they were a few degrees below average.
Alaska fully exited the season mid-month as a wet and cool patter took
hold across the Interior.  Hawaii experienced large fire activity as well;
however, the heavy rains from Hurricane Lane quickly reduced fire
potential across the state.

<h3 class="content">September is a transitional month for the West. Critical fire weather periods
become increasingly driven by occasional wind events resulting from
passing cold fronts or by a strong westerly flow. The transition this year
began a few weeks early. A shift to a fall-like pattern began the last week
of August. Overall normal significant large fire potential is expected in most
areas across the West except along the Canadian border with northeastern
Washington, extreme northern Idaho, and northwestern Montana where
above normal potential is expected. Debris from Hurricane Lane may
produce heavy dead fuel loadings across Hawaii which could become
receptive should abnormally dry conditions develop. Portions of
northwestern Nevada and northeastern California could remain elevated
as well given continued fuel dryness and a propensity for wind events. In
October, the continued seasonal transition into fall will allow for colder air
to become entrenched across the Great Basin thus creating a high
pressure ridge that should periodically induce Foehn Wind events across
both Northern and Southern California. Other regions across the West 
should fully exit fire season. In the East, preexisting drought conditions across the Great Lakes Region cloud
promote wind-driven events should the fuels remain dry after leaf drop. The remainder of the East is largely free
of drought entering late fall. </h3>

<h3 class="content">November and December are traditionally months where fire activity is reduced. The focus during this period
generally shifts from California to the Southeast where during dry years, significant fire activity can be observed.
Latest data suggests that the late fall period will experience at least average conditions if not wetter than average
conditions in some locations. So, Normal Significant Large Fire Potential is expected across most of country
during the remainder of the outlook period.</h3>

<h2 class="subheading">Past Weather and Drought</h2>

<h3 class="content">Temperatures across the country were generally above average for the first three weeks of August. Near
all-time record high temperatures were observed in many areas across the western portion of the Northern
Rockies and the eastern Great Basin on August 10 as a very strong thermal trough strengthened ahead
of an approaching cold front. Below Average temperatures were observed across most of the Great Plains
and the Mississippi River Valley. A pattern shift to fall-like conditions occurred the third week of the month.
Precipitation was generally well below average across the West, especially along the West Coast where
less than 25% of average was received. Across the Great Plains and the East, rainfall amounts were
generally above average with amounts of up to 400% of average across the southern-central Plains and
across the Mid-Atlantic states. </h3>

<h3 class="content">Severe to Exceptional Drought continued across the Southwest, but an active monsoon allowed for some
slight improvement. Drier than average conditions across the Northwest and along nearly the entire
Canadian Border allowed for drought intensification and expansion. Some improvement in the drought was
noted near the coastal areas of New England.
</h3>

<h2 class="subheading">Weather and Climate Outlooks</h2>

<h3 class="content">El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) should transition into a weak El
Niño by late September where it will persist into the winter months.
Latest forecasts suggests that this will be a weak to moderate event that
should end by early spring.</h3>

<img src="ENS.png">

<h3 class="content">While the El Niño is slowly evolving, weather patterns appear to be
transitioning accordingly and are supportive of an eventual
development. Overall, warmer and possibly drier than average
conditions are expected across the northwestern portion of the country.
This should lead to below average snowpack in the higher elevations
across portions of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies.
Further south, mountain snowpack will trend toward average as passing
systems are enhanced by a slightly more active subtropical jet stream
located over the southern United States. In the East, near average
temperatures are expected along with near average precipitation except
across the southeast where above average precipitation is possible.
</h3>

<h2 class="subheading">Geographic Area Forecasts</h2>

<h3 class="locationHeading">Alaska:</h3>

<h3 class="content">Normal significant wildland fire potential is expected for the
region during the outlook period.
</h3>

<h3 class="content">The U.S. Drought Monitor shows an area of Abnormally Dry conditions
in the northern Alaska Panhandle and Moderate drought in the southern
portion. The remainder of the state received greater than average
precipitation in August, the exception being the far northwest corner of
the state.</h3>

<h3 class="content">
Forecast outlook maps are forecasting warmer than average conditions
for western and southern Alaska in September and across the entire
state for the rest of the fall and early winter, with greatest chances of
warmer than average in the coastal areas. Wetter conditions are likely
for western Alaska in September, and drier than average conditions are
expected in the southern panhandle. The remainder of the year has
Alaska expecting above average precipitation with greatest chances of
above average on the north and south coasts. These forecasts seem
likely since many different forecast models have been indicating these
same trends. 
</h3>

<h3 class="content">Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System values show that surface
and duff layers are damp statewide. This does not preclude a warm and
dry spell bringing grasses and fine fuels back to burnable levels. There
are a few areas which are drier, notably the Yukon Flats and Noatak
Valley in the north, and the Chisana Valley in the far southeast Interior,
though starts are not expected with lack of ignition sources, cooler
temperatures and higher humidities.
</h3>

<h3 class="content">Alaska is passing out of fire season. September typically has little to no
fire activity. This year, heavy August rains and an already slow season
support little to no fire activity for September through December, which
is average.
</h3>

<h3 class="locationHeading">Northwest:</h3>

<h3 class="content">Above Normal significant wildland fire potential is expected across central and western
Oregon as well as south central and southeastern Washingtong in September. Normal significant wildland fire potential is expected in all areas from October through December. Areas not mentioned above can
expect Normal significant wildland fire potential during the outlook period.
</h3>

<h3 class="content">The summer was unusually warm and dry across the area until the latter half of August, when cooler
temperatures and moister air set in. Precipitation was well below average in all reporting areas, but wetting
rain finally fell across the northwestern areas and eastern mountains the last week of August.
Temperatures were above average across most of the region until late in in the month.</h3>

<h3 class="content">Outlooks for the region for late summer and autumn continue to suggest warmer and drier than average
conditions are probable. Drought conditions are expected to persist across Oregon and western
Washington and may spread into eastern Washington by November. Recent wetting rain and forecasted
potential for more precipitation in early September temper the outlook for a few areas. However, overall
warm and dry conditions are expected in most areas during September.</h3>

<h3 class="content">After remaining at or near record levels for much of July and August, ERC and 100 hour fuel moisture
finally dropped back to seasonally average levels under the influence of marine air in the latter part of the
month. 1000 hour fuels remain near record low levels, however, and live fuels across the region are cured
and are contributing to fire activity. While fire danger has dropped in the last couple of weeks, it is likely
to creep back up if the predicted warm and dry conditions are realized in the next few weeks. Fuels will
remain receptive to fire starts and the risk of large, costly fires is correspondingly elevated across the
region when critical combinations of weather and ignition sources are observed. </h3>

<h3 class="locationHeading">Northern California and Hawaii:</h3>

<h3 class="content">Above Normal significant large fire potential is expected for the entire
outlook area in September followed by a return to Normal potential for October through December except
for Hawaii which will retain Above Normal potential through December due to heavy fuel loading resulting
from Hurricane Lane and expected dry conditions.</h3>

<h3 class="content">August was warmer and drier than normal throughout the region. Almost all areas west of the CascadeSierra
ranges were considered Abnormally Dry by the U.S. Drought Monitor, with a large portion of that
area now in the Moderate Drought category. This was due to an overall precipitation deficit across the
state in place since October 1, 2017. However, the spring months were wetter than normal in most areas.
This led to an above normal crop of fine fuels and robust brush growth at mid and lower elevations. This
new crop of fine fuels and brush growth, combined with a large carryover fuel load from 2017, dried to
extreme levels by early August. Fuels of all size classes in most areas passed the 10th percentile fuel
moisture readings and in many cases reached their 3rd percentile values and set all-time records for
dryness, weeks ahead of the typical time period when they reach their lowest values of the dry season.
The overall fuel loading at elevations below 6000’ was reported to be 200% or more of average. Heavier
fuels at upper elevations have been reported to be much drier than average. Live fuel moisture values
have also reached critically low values, weeks ahead of normal. As a result, fire behavior has been extreme
and spread rates have been rapid at elevations below 6000’ this summer, even during non-wind events.
September is expected to be dry with near normal temperatures state-wide. Although lightning becomes
less frequent in September, moderate to strong dry offshore wind events become more common. Fuels
will continue to be extremely dry, and any ignitions will spread rapidly even with light to moderate winds.
The potential for large costly wildfires is above normal across the region in September. In October cooler
temperatures with higher humidity will push eastern areas back to the Normal category, and expected
rainfall in November and December will allow all parts of the North Ops region to return to the Normal
category.</h3>

<h3 class="content">Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) surrounding the Hawaiian Islands are above normal and are expected
to remain above normal through December. Average temperatures throughout the region are expected to
continue above normal through December. Outside of impacts from Hurricane Lane, rainfall has been
below normal throughout the summer, including August. Fuel loading is above normal and fire activity has
been more active than normal this summer. Conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific are favorable for
more tropical systems to approach the region. Damaged vegetation and debris caused by Hurricane Lane
may add to the fuel loading that is capable of carrying fire. The outlook calls for wetter than normal
conditions at least through September or October, but this is during the dry season when normal rainfall amounts are light. The potential of El Niño conditions in the equatorial Pacific during the fall and winter has
risen to more than 70%, and this pattern tends to produce drier than normal conditions during the Hawaiian
rainy season. Therefore, the significant large fire potential for Hawaii is Above Normal from September
through December.</h3>

<h3 class="locationHeading">Southern California:</h3>

<h3 class="content">Above Normal significant wildland fire potential is expected along the coast and
foothills across Southern California and the hills and mountains surrounding the central valley including
the Sierra in September and October. For the period November through December, these areas will retain
the elevated potential except for the central Sierra which will return to Normal potential. Areas not
mentioned above can expect Normal significant large fire potential through the outlook period. </h3>

<h3 class="content">August was another very warm month across the Geographic Area. Average temperatures were 6-8
degrees above normal with the greatest disparities occurring across the coastal regions. This was likely
due to near record high sea surface temperatures which reached nearly 80 degrees over portions of the
Southern California Bight. Conditions remained very humid over Southern California due to the
combination of subtropical moisture and a warmer than average marine layer. Some wetting rains occurred
over the Sierras eastward into Mono and portions of Inyo County and the desert sides of the San
Bernardino and Cleveland National Forests from monsoonal thunderstorms. Most other areas remained
dry during the past month. </h3>

<h3 class="content">Despite the humid weather, dead fuel moisture continued to drop to record low readings over many areas
outside the mountains. The central coast, Sierra Foothills and most of Southern California saw both 100
and 1000 hour dead fuel moisture surpass the driest conditions recorded by the second week of the month.
Higher humidity and slightly cooler weather caused these readings to level off during the last week of the
month in the smaller diameter fuels. Live fuel moisture reached critically dry conditions over most
elevations below 6,000 feet during the second week of the month. Therefore, live fuel moisture is close to
values usually seen in late September or early October.</h3>

<h3 class="content">Long range models indicate a persistent trough may develop over the Pacific Northwest. This would likely
keep the district under Southwesterly flow aloft with onshore flow at the surface. The monsoon may
remained bottled up over Arizona and the Southwest. Therefore, additional wet thunderstorms are unlikely
the rest of the summer. Temperatures will likely remain a few degrees above normal, but the prolonged
heat waves of July and August are not expected. Local studies indicate there may be a near normal, or
slightly below normal, number of offshore wind days through November which matches the pattern seen
in the long range models. However, 2-3 offshore wind events will likely occur prior to the onset of significant
wetting rains in October or early November. </h3>

<h3 class="content">In November, large fire potential is expected to trend back to near normal levels from north to south. By
early December, most areas will have received enough rainfall to preclude large fire activity. Most model
ensemble members point to a weak El Nino this winter, or perhaps a Modoki El Nino pattern. In this second
scenario, precipitation would be below normal across the district, but it is too soon to draw any conclusions
about the expected precipitation for the entire winter. </h3>
